    <h2>Nephi</h2>

    <h3>What I love about BYU-Idaho</h3>
    <p>One thing I personally love about byu Idaho is the oppurtunity to take a course and the numerous ways that one can get help studying that course from 
        video tutuorials to tutors and also instructors who are always ever ready to help you out with your problem. Also how the have religion attached to the 
        studies help student focus more on the Lord and not only on the circular stuff.
        The degree I am pursuing is WDD.
    </p>
    <p>The advantage I see with this course is how everything is being uploaded to the internet and the fast growth rate of the internet 
        and also the develpment of technology making it a very good advantage for everyone with knowledge about these things have a significant role in 
        the technologyical world.
